"DevOps plays a crucial role in modern software development by bridging the gap between development (Dev) and operations (Ops) teams. It focuses on collaboration, automation, and continuous integration & delivery (CI/CD) to improve the software development lifecycle"

"DevOps enables teams to release software updates frequently and efficiently through automation and CI/CD pipelines. This reduces the time from development to production, ensuring that new features and bug fixes reach users quickly."

"Traditional development and operations teams often work in silos, leading to inefficiencies. DevOps fosters a culture of collaboration, allowing developers, testers, and operations teams to work together seamlessly."
